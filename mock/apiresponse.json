However, the company faced regulatory setbacks with the FDA issuing a second complete response letter (CRL) for its lymphoma drug odronextamab due to manufacturing issues at a third-party plant, requiring reapplication. The approval of Eylea HD's expanded indications also faces delays related to the same manufacturing facility. Additionally, a pivotal phase 3 study readout for the anti-Lag3 drug fianlimab has been postponed to early 2026 due to slower event progression. Despite these challenges, Regeneron continues to advance its oncology pipeline with multiple Phase III trials and anticipates further regulatory milestones later in the year."
